# FlashcardLanguageApp
Application that teaches users the alphabets of various languages. Relies on simple, efficient repetition to build neural networks as quickly as possible.

Purpose of this Project
This is my first EVER full app developed entirely by me. I saw a big hole in the Alphabet Flashcard Systems Online and I want to introduce a fully interactive application that will teach the user one of several major alphabets in as little time as possible. Within an hour the user can have the basics down of any language system. The idea is that the user will subconsciously retain the information due
to the sheer volume of repetition and the comfort of allowing oneself to be wrong UNTIL you are naturally right. One of the most difficult part of finding an accurate repetition system is that they ofter
muddle the repetition with more complex additions.

My Theory On The Market
Many systems do an excellent job with the interface, but focus on too many aspects that don't truly enhance the user's ability to retain the information. Here the primary focus is repetition, all else is
secondary. This means that the user will not be "graded" on their ability to remember. Fail until success comes natural.

Inspiration
This app pulls a great deal from the Spaced Repetition System Anki (http://ankisrs.net/) but even greater from the simple app I found while learning the Korean writing system Hangul (here:
http://www.aeriagloris.com/LearnKorean/). Hangul was created to be an easy writing system, so I had the idea of making it as simple as possible for users to learn the writing system of ANY language with
just this app.

Usage
The user is FREE to use this appication by it's original inteded use only. This mean that the user has the right to click from the list of available characters as well as determine which writing system
she or he wishes to learn and in what order they would like to learn it from. The user must credit me when using the application in her/his work if it is used on another site.

Future Additions To This Project
1) An iOS/Android Application that takes the online content to users smartphones.
2) Additional themes that the user can select to better focus on the app.
3) A timer that indicates how long the user has used the app.
4) Typing practice in the new language -- giving users the chance to use the
   associated keyboard with that country.

The App And How It Works
The interface is simple, just the character in the center of the page, five choices of corresponding characters at the bottom and the option to change the learned language as well as the applied language
(the langauge the user is using to learn the new language). The following languages will be included in the original application:
          1) Japanese
          2) Korean
          3) Arabic
          4) Hindi
          5) Russian
          6) French
          7) English (default language)
          8) Malayalam
The user can select from any of those languages. The user may even use a single language for both the learned and applied languages. This allows the user to repeat the characters at a faster pace, making
learning more natural and building neuro pathways that allow the user to better remember the characters for longer.
The default background is black (#000000), drawing attention to the characters and options and allowing the user to use the application for longer -- darker colors cause less eye-strain.
The default character color is white (#FFFFFF), creating a perfect contrast and emphasizing the characters.
Additional Themese May Be Choosen Using The Hexidecimal System (#xxxxxx). <-- This may/may not apply to the original version.


The only way to do it is to do it.
